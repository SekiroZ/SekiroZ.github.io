<p><b>The Answer</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Baseness is a passport for the base,</p>
<p>Honour an epitaph for the honourable.</p>
<p>See how the gilded sky teems</p>
<p>With the twisted shadows of the dead.</p>
<p>The ice age is over,</p>
<p>So why does ice still bind the world?</p>
<p>The Cape of Good Hope has been discovered,</p>
<p>So why is the Dead Sea still thick with sails?</p>
<p>I come into this world</p>
<p>Carrying only paper, rope and a shadow,</p>
<p>To proclaim before judgment is passed</p>
<p>This plea of the judged:</p>
<p>Listen to me, world,</p>
<p>I – do – not – believe!</p>
<p>If a thousand challengers lie beneath your feet</p>
<p>Then I am number one thousand and one.</p>
<p>I don’t believe the sky is blue;</p>
<p>I don’t believe the thunder’s roar;</p>
<p>I don’t believe that dreams are false;</p>
<p>I don’t believe that death has no revenge.</p>
<p>If the ocean is destined to break the dike;</p>
<p>Then let its bitter water pour into my soul;</p>
<p>If the land is destined to rise,</p>
<p>Then let mankind choose a new mountain for survival.</p>
<p>The vast unobstructed firmament</p>
<p>Is it with glimmering stars;</p>
<p>They are a new turning:</p>
<p>These hieroglyphs of the ages,</p>
<p>These staring eyes of the future.</p>
